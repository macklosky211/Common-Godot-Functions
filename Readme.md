This is a list of the most common functionality between all of my godot-based games, most of it is just enviornment setup such as the EventBus or NetworkManager, most of these must be redesigned with the creation of a new project so having a common implimenation helps streamline that process. 

# Highlights
 - [Multiplayer](https://github.com/macklosky211/Common-Godot-Functions/tree/main/Common%20Scripts/Network%20and%20Multiplayer)
   - Basic Godot implimentation of ENet multiplayer, I commonly refer to this when making multiplayer games for a template to work from.
 - [Player State Machine](https://github.com/macklosky211/Common-Godot-Functions/blob/main/Common%20Entities/Player3D/player_system.gd)
   - State machines are really good, and this can be re-used everywhere, this is just labeled 'Player' for clarity sake.
